# SurfaceNets infinite terrain demo
Using Godot 4.4 C#

#### Origin
This was originally supposed to be a game but i got overwhelmed by its scope.
So i will at least share my current progress here with anyone who wants to implement this cool terrain rendering method.
Maybe i will return to it in the future when I'll have some more time.
